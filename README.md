# Overview - 
* Our aim is to create an application that will take 3 APIs (Ticket Master, Weather & Park Whiz) and combine them into one application where users can get the most information and make their plans come together. 


* Our target audience will range anywhere from locals, tourist, avid event goers etc. Open to all age groups and interests.

* Our application will eliminate headaches that pop up when attending events. Our application will help find the events, pull the weather forecast & even help the uesr find the cheapest and convient parking. It will be a "one stop shop" for concerts/events.

* The primary goal of our project is to make finding, scheduling & arriving to events 10x easier with the search tools and added info in our app. Upon one search, users should be able to find, forecast and park stressfree without having to figure things out as they go.
